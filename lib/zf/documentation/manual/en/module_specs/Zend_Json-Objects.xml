    <title>JSON Objects</title>
    <para>
        When encoding PHP objects as JSON, all public properties of that object
        will be encoded in a JSON object.
    </para>
    <para>
        JSON does not allow object references, so care should be taken not to
        encode objects with recursive references. If you have issues with
        recursion, <code>Zend_Json::encode()</code> and
        <code>Zend_Json_Encoder::encode()</code> allow an optional second
        parameter to check for recursion; if an object is serialized twice, an
        exception will be thrown.
    </para>
    <para>
        Decoding JSON objects poses an additional difficulty, however, since
        Javascript objects correspond most closely to PHP's associative array.
        Some suggest that a class identifier should be passed, and an object
        instance of that class should be created and populated with the
        key/value pairs of the JSON object; others feel this could pose a
        substantial security risk.
    </para>
    <para>
        By default, <code>Zend_Json</code> will decode JSON objects as
        associative arrays. However, if you desire an object returned, you can
        specify this:
    </para>
    <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[
// Decode JSON objects as PHP objects
$phpNative = Zend_Json::decode($encodedValue, Zend_Json::TYPE_OBJECT);
]]>
    </programlisting>
    <para>
        Any objects thus decoded are returned as <code>StdClass</code> objects
        with properties corresponding to the key/value pairs in the JSON
        notation.
    </para>
    <para>
        The recommendation of Zend Framework is that the individual
        developer should decide how to decode JSON objects. If an object of a
        specified type should be created, it can be created in the developer
        code and populated with the values decoded using <code>Zend_Json</code>.
    </para>
