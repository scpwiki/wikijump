    <para>
        The <code>Zend_Controller</code> system is designed to be
        lightweight, modular, and extensible.  It is a minimalist design to
        permit flexibility and some freedom to users while providing enough
        structure so that systems built around <code>Zend_Controller</code>
        share some common conventions and similar code layout.

        describes in detail the interactions:

        The <code>Zend_Controller</code> workflow is implemented by several
        components.  While it is not necessary to completely understand the
        underpinnings of all of these components to use the system, having a
        working knowledge of the process is helpful.

                    <code>Zend_Controller_Front</code> orchestrates the entire
                    workflow of the <code>Zend_Controller</code> system.  It is
                    an interpretation of the FrontController pattern.
                    <code>Zend_Controller_Front</code> processes all requests
                    received by the server and is ultimately responsible for
                    delegating requests to ActionControllers
                    (<code>Zend_Controller_Action</code>).

                    <code>Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract</code> (often
                    referred to as the <code>Request Object</code>) represents
                    the request environment and provides methods for setting and
                    retrieving the controller and action names and any request
                    parameters. Additionally it keeps track of whether or not
                    the action it contains has been dispatched by
                    <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher</code>.  Extensions to the
                    abstract request object can be used to encapsulate the
                    entire request environment, allowing routers to pull
                    information from the request environment in order to set the
                    controller and action names.

                <para>
                    By default, <code>Zend_Controller_Request_Http</code> is
                    used, which provides access to the entire HTTP request
                    environment.

                    <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Interface</code> is used to
                    define routers.  Routing is the process of examining the
                    request environment to determine which controller, and
                    action of that controller, should receive the request.  This
                    controller, action, and optional parameters are then set in
                    the request object to be processed by
                    <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard</code>.  Routing
                    occurs only once: when the request is initially received and
                    before the first controller is dispatched.

                <para>
                    The default router,
                    <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite</code>, takes a URI
                    endpoint as specified in
                    <code>Zend_Controller_Request_Http</code> and decomposes it
                    into a controller, action, and parameters based on the path
                    information in the url. As an example, the URL
                    <code>http://localhost/foo/bar/key/value</code> would be
                    decoded to use the <code>foo</code> controller,
                    <code>bar</code> action, and specify a parameter
                    <code>key</code> with a value of <code>value</code>.

                <para>
                    <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite</code> can also be used
                    to match arbitrary paths; see <link
                        linkend="zend.controller.router">the router

                    <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Interface</code> is used to
                    define dispatchers.  Dispatching is the process of pulling
                    the controller and action from the request object and
                    mapping them to a controller file/class and action method in
                    the controller class. If the controller or action do not
                    exist, it handles determining default controllers and
                    actions to dispatch.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The actual dispatching process consists of instantiating the
                    controller class and calling the action method in that
                    class. Unlike routing, which occurs only once, dispatching
                    occurs in a loop. If the request object's dispatched status
                    is reset at any point, the loop will be repeated, calling
                    whatever action is currently set in the request object. The
                    first time the loop finishes with the request object's
                    dispatched status set (boolean true), it will finish
                    processing.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The default dispatcher is
                    <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard</code>. It defines
                    controllers as MixedCasedClasses ending in the word
                    Controller, and action methods as camelCasedMethods ending
                    in the word Action:
                    <code>FooController::barAction()</code>. In this case, the
                    controller would be referred to as <code>foo</code> and
                    the action as <code>bar</code>.

                        Since humans are notoriously inconsistent at
                        maintaining case sensitivity when typing links, Zend
                        Framework actually normalizes path information to
                        lowercase. This, of course, will affect how you name
                        your controller and actions... or refer to them in
                        links.

                    <para>
                        If you wish to have your controller class or action
                        method name have multiple MixedCasedWords or
                        camelCasedWords, you will need to separate those words
                        on the url with either a '-' or '.' (though you can
                        configure the character used).

                    <para>
                        As an example, if you were going to the action in
                        <code>FooBarController::bazBatAction()</code>, you'd
                        refer to it on the url as <code>/foo-bar/baz-bat</code>
                        or <code>/foo.bar/baz.bat</code>.

                    <code>Zend_Controller_Action</code> is the base action
                    controller component.  Each controller is a single class
                    that extends the <code>Zend_Controller_Action class</code>
                    and should contain one or more action methods.

                    <code>Zend_Controller_Response_Abstract</code> defines a
                    base response class used to collect and return responses
                    from the action controllers. It collects both headers and
                    body content.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The default response class is
                    <code>Zend_Controller_Response_Http</code>, which is
                    suitable for use in an HTTP environment.

    <para>
        The workflow of <code>Zend_Controller</code> is relatively simple.  A
        request is received by <code>Zend_Controller_Front</code>, which in turn
        calls <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite</code> to determine which
        controller (and action in that controller) to dispatch.
        <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite</code> decomposes the URI in order
        to set the controller and action names in the request.
        <code>Zend_Controller_Front</code> then enters a dispatch loop.  It
        calls <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard</code>, passing it the
        request, to dispatch to the controller and action specified in the
        request (or use defaults).  After the controller has finished, control
        returns to <code>Zend_Controller_Front</code>.  If the controller has
        indicated that another controller should be dispatched by resetting the
        dispatched status of the request, the loop continues and another
        dispatch is performed.  Otherwise, the process ends.
