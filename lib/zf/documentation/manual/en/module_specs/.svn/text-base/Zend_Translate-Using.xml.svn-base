    <title>Using Translation Adapters</title>

    <para>
        The example above shows some output with no support for translation.
        You probably write your code in your native language.
        Generally you need to translate not only the output,
        but also error messages and log messages.
    </para>

    <para>
        The next step is to include Zend Translate in your existing code.
        Of course it is much easier if you are writing your code using
        Zend_Translate instead of changing your code afterwards.

print $translate->_("Fix language here is line two") . "\n";
]]>
        </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
        Now let's get a deeper look into what has been done and how to
        integrate Zend_Translate into your code.
    </para>

    <para>
        Create a new Translation object and define the base adapter:

        <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[
$translate = new Zend_Translate('gettext', '/my/path/source-de.mo', 'de');
]]>
        </programlisting>

        In this example we decided the
        <emphasis role="strong">Gettext Adapter</emphasis>.
        We place our file <emphasis role="strong">source-de.mo</emphasis>
        into the directory <emphasis role="strong">/my/path</emphasis>.
        The gettext file will have German translation included.
        And we also added another language source for French.
    </para>

    <para>
        The next step is to wrap all strings which are to be translated.
        The simplest approach is to have only simple strings or sentences
        like this:

        <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[
print $translate->_("Example")."\n";
print "=======\n";
print $translate->_("Here is line one")."\n";
]]>
        </programlisting>

        Some strings do not needed to be translated.
        The separating line is always a separating line,
        even in other languages.
    </para>

    <para>
        Having data values integrated into a translation string is also
        supported through the use of embedded parameters.

        <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[
printf($translate->_("Today is the %1\$s") . "\n", date("d.m.Y"));
]]>
        </programlisting>

        Instead of <code>print()</code>, use the <code>printf()</code>
        function and replace all parameters with <code>%1\$s</code> parts.
        The first is <code>%1\$s</code>, the second <code>%2\$s</code>,
        and so on. This way a translation can be done without knowing
        the exact value. In our example, the date is always the actual day,
        but the string can be translated without the knowledge of the actual
        day.
    </para>

    <para>
        Each string is identified in the translation storage by a message id.
        You can use message id's instead of strings in your code, like this:

        <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[
print $translate->_(1)."\n";
print "=======\n";
print $translate->_(2)."\n";
]]>
        </programlisting>

        But doing this has several disadvantages:
    </para>

    <para>
        You can not see what your code should output just by viewing your code.
    </para>

    <para>
        Also you will get problems if some strings are not translated.
        You always must imagine how translation works.
        First Zend_Translate looks if the set language has a translation
        for the given message id or string.
        If no translation string has been found it refers to the next lower
        language as defined within Zend_Locale.
        So "<emphasis role="strong">de_AT</emphasis>" becomes
        "<emphasis role="strong">de</emphasis>" only.
        If there is no translation found for
        "<emphasis role="strong">de</emphasis>" either,
        then the original message is returned.
        This way you always have an output, in case the message translation
        does not exist in your message storage.
        Zend_Translate never throws an error or exception when translating
        strings.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="zend.translate.using.structure">

        <title>Translation Source Structures</title>

        <para>
            Your next step is to create the translation sources for the several
            languages to which you translate.
            Every adapter is created its own way as described here.
            But there are some general features that are relevant for all adapters.

            You should know where to store your translation source files.
            With Zend_Translate you are not bound to any restriction.

            Array source files are just arrays.  But you have to define them

            But because they are so simple, it's the fastest way to look up
            messages if your code works as expected.  It's generally the best

            Gettext source files are created by GNU's gettext library.

            These files have the ending <emphasis role="strong">*.mo</emphasis>

            As you can see the adapters are used exactly the same way,
            with only just one small difference.
            Change 'array' to 'gettext'.  All other usages are exactly
            the same as with all other adapters.
            With the gettext adapter you no longer have to be aware of
            gettext's standard directory structure,
            bindtextdomain and textdomain.
            Just give the path and filename to the adapter.
        </para>

        <note>
            <para>
                 You should always use UTF-8 as source encoding.
                 Otherwise you will have problems if you are using two
                 different source encodings.
                 For example, if one of your source files is encoded
                 with ISO-8815-11 and another file is encoded with CP815.
                 You can set only one encoding for your source file,
                 so one of your languages probably will not display correctly.
            </para>
            <para>
                 UTF-8 is a portable format which supports all languages.
                 If you use UTF-8 encoding for all languages, you eliminate
                 the problem of incompatible encodings.

            Many gettext editors add adapter informations as empty translation string.

            provided by the <code>getAdapterInfo()</code> method. It will return
            the adapter informations for all added gettext files as array where the

            INI files have several restrictions. If a value in the ini file contains any
            non-alphanumeric characters it needs to be enclosed in double-quotes (").
            There are also reserved words which must not be used as keys for ini files.
            These include: null, yes, no, true, and false. Values null, no and false results
            in "", yes and true results in "1". Characters {}|&amp;~![()" must not be used anywhere
            in the key and have a special meaning in the value. Do not use them as you will
            have unexpected behaviour.

            Options can be used with all adapters. Of course the options are different for all adapters.
            You can set options when you create the adapter. Actually there is one option which is available
            to all adapters. '<code>clear</code>' decides if translation data should be added to existing
            one or not. Standard behaviour is to add new translation data to existing one. But the
            translation data is only cleared for the selected language. So all other languages will not be
            touched.
        </para>

        <para>
            You can set options temporary when using <code>addTranslation($data, $locale, array $options = array())</code>
            as third and optional parameter. And you can use the <code>setOptions()</code> function to
            set the options fix.

            When you want to have self defined options, you are also able to use them within all adapters.
            The <code>setOptions()</code> method can be used to define your option. <code>setOptions()</code>
            needs an array with the options you want to set. If an given option exists it will be signed over.
            You can define as much options as needed as they will not be checked by the adapter. Just get sure
            that you do not sign over any existing option which is used by an adapter.
        </para>

        <para>
            To return the set option you can use the <code>getOptions()</code> method. When <code>getOptions()</code>
            is called without an parameter it will return all set options. When the optional parameter is given
            you will only get the particular option returned.

        <title>Handling languages</title>

        <para>
            When working with different languages there are a few methods which will be useful.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <code>getLocale()</code> method can be used to get the actual set language. It can either hold
            an instance of <code>Zend_Locale</code> or the identifier of a locale.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <code>setLocale()</code> method sets a new standard language for translation. This prevents the
            need of setting the optional language parameter more than once to the <code>translate()</code> method.
            If the given language does not exist, or no translation data is available for the language,
            <code>setLocale()</code> tries to downgrade to the language without the region if any was given.
            A language of <code>en_US</code> would be downgraded to <code>en</code>. When also the downgraded
            language can not be found an exception will be thrown.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <code>isAvailable()</code> method checks if a given language is already available. It returns
            <code>true</code> if data for the given language exist.
        </para>

        <para>
            And finally the <code>getList()</code> method can be used to get all actual set languages for an adapter
            returned as array.

                    not declared it is recommended that you use file detection in such situations.

            <para>
                Another way to detect the language automatically is to use special filenames. You can either
                name the complete file or parts of a file with the used language. To use this way of detection
                you will have to set the 'scan' option at initiation. There are several ways of naming the
                sourcefiles which are described below:

                    Zend_Translate is also capable of detecting the language if it is included within the
                    filename. But if you use this way you will have to separate the language with a token.
                    There are three supported tokens which can be used: A point '.', a underline '_', or
                    a hyphen '-'.

        <title>Checking for translations</title>

        <para>
            Normally text will be translated without any computations. But sometimes it is necessary to
            know if a text is translated or not within the source. Therefor the <code>isTranslated()</code>
            method can be used.
        </para>

        <para>
            <code>isTranslated($messageId, $original = false, $locale = null)</code> takes as first parameter
            the text from which you want to know if it can be translated. And as optional third parameter the locale
            for which you want to know the translation. The optional second parameter declares if translation
            is fixed to the declared language or a lower set of translations can be used. If you have a text which
            can be translated by 'en' but not for 'en_US' you will normally get the translation returned, but by
            setting <code>$original</code> to true, the <code>isTranslated()</code> method will return false in
            such cases.

        <title>Access to the source data</title>

        <para>
            Of course sometimes it is useful to have access to the translation source data. Therefor two
            functions exist.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <code>getMessageIds($locale = null)</code> method returns all known message ids as array.

        <para>
            And the <code>getMessages($locale = null)</code> method returns the complete translation source as
            array. The message id is used as key and the translation data as value.
        </para>

        <para>
            Both methods accept an optional parameter <code>$locale</code> which, when set, returns the
            translation data for the specified language. If this parameter is not given, the actual set
            language will be used. Keep in mind that normally all translations should be available in all
            languages. Which means that in a normal situation you will not have to set this parameter.
        </para>

        <para>
            Additionally the <code>getMessages()</code> method is able to return the complete
            translation dictionary with the pseudo-locale 'all'. This will return all available
            translation data for each added locale.
