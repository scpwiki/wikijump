    #   INFO: <detailed description>
    #   EXAMPLE: <example codeblock>
    #
    # The block INFO is rendered with FTML.

    anchor:
      TITLE: Anchor
      INFO: >
        Creates links between pages or other web pages. Like the HTML {{<a>}} tag, the
        {{href}} attribute needs to be used with the {{[[anchor]]}} block.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[a href="/scp-4000/noredirect/true" target="_blank" class="dual-link"]]Fae[[/a]]

    blockquote:
      TITLE: Blockquote
      INFO: >
        Indicates that enclosed text is an extended quotation,
        although the "extended quotation" interpretation of blockquotes
        may not be how they're used in practice. The meaning of blockquotes
        differs from site-to-site and often depends on the styling given to them.

        Using the {{[[blockquote]]}} block is the same as using {{> text}},
        with the difference only being the syntax used.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[blockquote]]
        Some text here.
        [[/blockquote]]
        [!-- equivalent to --]
        > Some text here.

    bold:
      TITLE: Bold
      INFO: >
        Bolds the enclosed text.
        Using {{[[bold]]}} is the same as using {{@<**bold**>@}},
        with the difference only being the syntax used.
      EXAMPLE: |
        Some [[b]]text![[/b]]
        [!-- equivalent to --]
        Some **text!**

    char:
      TITLE: Char
      INFO: >
        Renders an HTML entity (a special character) in place of the block.

        Note: The syntax for HTML entities is simplified for convinence. Normally,
        you would need to write {{&copy;}} to display the copyright symbol in HTML, but
        with the {{[[char]]}} block you just need to write {{copy}}.

        [[[https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref | List of HTML entities]]]
      EXAMPLE: |
        This file is [[char copy]] 2021 Team Wikijump.

    checkbox:
      TITLE: Checkbox
      INFO: >
        Creates an interactive checkbox input that can be checked or unchecked.

        Providing the {{*}} prefix sets the checkbox to start checked.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[checkbox Apple]]
        [[*checkbox Blueberry]]
        [[checkbox Cherry]]
        [[checkbox Durian]]

    code:
      TITLE: Code
      INFO: >
        Renders the enclosed text raw, with all whitespace preserved.
        Intended for use with programming code and the like.

        Providing the {{type}} argument sets the enclosed text to be
        rendered with syntax highlighting, if the specified language
        is available.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[code]]
        This text is **not** rendered as Wikitext, but output as-is!
        [[/code]]
        [!-- or, with syntax highlighting --]
        [[code type="javascript"]]
        console.log("foo"); // syntax highlighted as JS!
        [[/code]]

    collapsible:
      TITLE: Collapsible
      INFO: >
        Creates an interactive block that can be expanded or folded,
        and when expanded, will display its contents.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[collapsible
          show="+ Spoilers for Ouroboros"
          hide="- Spoilers!"
          hideLocation="bottom"
        ]]
        Overseers die.
        [[/collapsible]]

    css:
      TITLE: CSS
      INFO: >
        Adds a CSS stylesheet to the page, using the enclosed text as the source.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[css]]
        #page-title {
          color: purple;
        }
        [[/css]]

    del:
      TITLE: Deletion
      INFO: >
        Denotes that the enclosed text has been "deleted" from the document.
        The text is not literally deleted, instead, it is styled or otherwise
        set to appear as deleted.

        Depending on context, this may have different meanings. In the context
        of a story, the deleted text may be a storytelling element, representing
        something diagetically deleted from a document. In a programming context,
        it may represent code that was deleted from a file, e.g. in a diff.
      EXAMPLE: |
        I [[del]]don't[[/del]] like that haircut.

    div:
      TITLE: Div
      INFO: >
        Creates a generic block container element,
        which may be styled, given a class/ID, etc.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[div_ class="blockquote" style="border: none;"]]
        Some text __here!__
        [[/div]]

    footnote:
      TITLE: Footnote
      INFO: >
        Adds an expandable footnote, which a reader may use to view the contents by of
        hovering or focusing on a numbered marker. The footnote's contents will also be
        displayed in a "footnote block" at (by default) the bottom of the page.
      EXAMPLE: |
        The author of The Dark Tower series[[footnote]]Did you know that world-renowned writer Stephen King was once hit by a car? Just something to consider.[[/footnote]] began work in the late 1970s.

    footnote-block:
      TITLE: Footnote Block
      INFO: >
        Moves the footnote block. The "footnote block" is added to a page whenever it has
        any {{[[footnote]]}} elements, and by default it's placed at the bottom of the
        page. This block lets you move it, if so desired. If having a footnote block at
        all is undesirable, you can use the {{hide}} argument to remove it.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[footnote-block title="Endnotes"]]
        [[footnote-block title="Stephen King Car Crash Facts"]]

    hidden:
      TITLE: Hidden
      INFO: >
        Styles the enclosed block of text as being hidden.
        This block does not delete or otherwise prevent the enclosed text from
        being rendered, instead, it sets the text to be invisible. A reader who
        is persistent enough will be able to find the text.
      EXAMPLE: |
        This text is **visible**.
        [[hidden]]
        This text is not.
        [[/hidden]]

    html:
      TITLE: HTML
      INFO: >
        Renders the enclosed block of text in an {{<iframe>}} element.
        In other words, it allows the insertion of arbitrary HTML markup in a safe way.
        This can be used to embed widgets or even games.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[html]]
        <h2>Exciting!</h2>
        <p>
        This HTML will appear in an iframe hosted on wjfiles!
        </p>
        [[/html]]

    ifcategory:
      TITLE: ifcategory
      INFO: >
        Sets the enclosed text to be conditionally rendered depending on if the
        page is in, or is not in, certain categories.

        Syntax:

        * {{+<category>}} Requires that the page is in the category.

        * {{-<category>}} Requires that the page //is not// in the category.

        Additionally, the {{+}} prefix can be omitted, as in just typing {{<category>}}.
        The {{+}} is assumed if no other prefix is present.

        Finally, as a page cannot be in more than one category at once, having multiple
        {{+<category>}} statements acts as an {{OR}} conditional. In other words,
        the page has to be //in one of// the listed (positive) categories.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[ifcategory _default]]
        Will render if the page is in the default category.
        [[/ifcategory]]

        [[ifcategory +_default +component -fragment]]
        This will render if the page is in either the _default or component categories.
        But if the page is in the fragment category, this won't render.
        [[/ifcategory]]

        [[ifcategory -_default]]
        Will only render if the page is in a category that isn't the default.
        [[/ifcategory]]

    iftags:
      TITLE: iftags
      INFO: >
        Sets the enclosed text to be conditionally rendered depending on if the
        page does or does not have certain tags.

        Syntax:

        * {{<tag>}} Requires that this tag, or any other {{<tag>}}, is present.

        * {{+<tag>}} Requires that the tag is present.

        * {{-<tag>}} Requires that the tag //is not// present.

        To explain the first syntax ({{<tag>}}) further, all {{<tag>}} statements are
        "lumped together" and checked. If _any_ of them are present, this check passes.
        This is exactly like an {{OR}} conditional. This differs from how the {{+<tag>}}
        and {{-<tag>}} syntaxes behave, which demand that the tag is or is not present.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[iftags +science]]
        This page is labeled as: science.
        [[/iftags]]

        [[iftags +bug -fixed]]
        This is a bug, and it's not fixed yet.
        [[/iftags]]

    iframe:
      TITLE: iframe
      INFO: >
        Creates an {{<iframe>}} element in place. This allows for the embedding of
        external content, given an URL to said content.
        This is similar to the {{[[html]]}} element.
      EXAMPLE: |
        My website:
        [[iframe https://example.com/ class="website"]]

    image:
      TITLE: Image
      INFO: >
        Embeds an image in the rendered document.

        Accepts the following prefixes:

        * {{=}} Centers the image

        * {{<}} Aligns the image to the left

        * {{>}} Aligns the image to the right

        * {{f<}} Floats the image to the left, allowing text to wrap around it

        * {{f>}} Floats the image to the right, allowing text to wrap around it
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[image green_apple.png alt="A green apple" title="Take a big bite!" style="width: 100%;" class="fruity"]]
        [[image https://example.com/my-image.png]]
        [[image /some-other-page/my-picture.jpeg]]
        [[=image landscape.png]]
        [[<image landscape.png]]
        [[>image landscape.png]]
        [[f<image landscape.png]]
        [[f>image landscape.png]]
        [[image filename.png link="#section"]]
        [[image filename.png link="SCP-001"]]
        [[image filename.png link="https://example.com/"]]

    include-elements:
      TITLE: Include (Elements)
      INFO: >
        Injects another page's contents. This lets you //include// something without
        copy-pasting it, which allows for reusable content, like pre-made headers and
        footers. Includes can accept arguments, and these arguments replace any
        placeholders of the same name when the page is injected.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[include-elements component:some-bar
          class="Keter"
          classification="4"
          taskforce="MTF-Eta-10 (\"See No Evil\")"
        ]]

    include-messy:
      TITLE: Include (Messy)
      INFO: >
        You shouldn't use this block unless you have to. This block takes another page's
        contents and literally pastes it directly into your page's source prior to
        rendering. The only reason it exists is for compatibility with Wikidot content.
        Use {{[[include-elements]]}} instead.
      EXAMPLE: |
        [[include-messy theme:black-highlighter-theme]]

        [[include-messy component:fancy-object-class
          class=Keter |
          classification=4 |
          taskforce=MTF-Eta-10 ("See No Evil")
        ]]

    ins:

        This does not insert the enclosed text in some special way, instead, it is
        styled or otherwise set to appear inserted.

        Depending on context, this may have different meanings. In the context
        of a story, the inserted text may be a storytelling element, representing
        something diagetically inserted into a document. In a programming context,
        it may represent new code that was inserted into a file, e.g. in a diff.
      EXAMPLE: |
        I would like some [[ins]]anchovy[[/ins]] pizza please, thank you.
