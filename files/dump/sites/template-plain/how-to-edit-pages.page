How To Edit Pages

If you are allowed to edit pages in this Site, simply click on //edit// button at the bottom of the page. This will open an editor with a toolbar pallette with options.

To create a link to a new page, use syntax: {{``[[[new page name]]]``}} or {{``[[[new page name | text to display]]]``}}. Follow the link (which should have a different color if page does not exist) and create a new page and edit it!

Although creating and editing pages is easy, there are a lot more options that allows creating powerful sites. Please visit [*http://www.wikidot.org/doc Documentation pages] to learn more.
