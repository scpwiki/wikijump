    /// The `rsmq_async` crate provides two sets of methods for retrieving jobs:
    /// 1. `pop_message()`
    ///
    /// This removes a job from the queue and yields it to a worker. If the worker
    /// then dies, the job is no longer on the queue and thus is effectively lost.
    ///
    /// 2. `receive_message()` followed by `delete_message()`
    ///
    /// This receives a job from the queue, during which time the job can no longer
    /// be picked up by any other consumers. This prevents work being done twice.
    ///
    /// After the job execution period, if no further updates are received, then the
    /// queue assumes the worker died or failed, and then the job is later available
    /// on the queue for workers to retry.
    ///
    /// This means that, after a `receive_message()`, if and only if the job was
    /// successfully run (aside from any cases where we specifically decide we do
    /// not want this job to re-run), we will then run `delete_message()` so that
    /// it is no longer enqueued.
