#![allow(unused_imports)]

//! The "services" module, providing low-level logical operations.
//!
//! Each service is named for a particular object or concept, and
//! provides several low-level methods for interacting with it.
//! This may be CRUD, or small operations which should be composed
//! into larger ones.
//!
//! As such, **all methods here are _not_ contained in transactions,**
//! the expectation is that the caller will use transactions when needed.
//! For methods which make multiple calls, they will assert that they
//! are currently in a transaction, if you are not then they will raise
//! an error.
//!
//! These methods are called as component operations either by other
//! services or by route implementations found in the `methods` module.
