# Direct page links

- Feature ID: `page-links`
- Category: `site-structure`
- Documentation status: `documented`
- Specification source: frozen local Wikidot documentation corpus
- Behavioral authority: documentation-derived; live Wikidot wins if tested behavior conflicts

## Purpose

Implement the documented Wikidot site-structure capability “Direct page links”, including its identity, relationships, routes, and rendering implications.

## Implementation contract

- The persistence model MUST represent the documented entity and relationships.
- Public links, routes, selection behavior, permissions, and rendered structure MUST preserve those relationships.
- Imported Wikidot identifiers and URLs MUST remain compatibility-stable.

Every explicit default, accepted value, rejected value, alias, limit, interaction, output form, URL form, permission rule, and stated limitation in the evidence below is part of this specification. Examples are conformance fixtures. Text that merely describes the documentation site or presents a live demo is informative rather than normative.

If the documentation is silent or contradictory, the implementation MUST fail closed or preserve the existing literal behavior until a live Wikidot experiment supplies a stable expectation. The spec and catalog must then be updated with that evidence.


## Suggested public TDD seams

These seams are recommendations. The implementation agent must present and confirm the actual seam map before writing tests.

- Public HTTP route and browser-visible UI
- Public service/API boundary for persistent state and permissions

## Feature-specific implementation notes

- No feature-specific implementation note beyond the corpus contract.

```wikidot
L0025 ++ Direct links between pages
L0026 
L0027 All the pages within a Site are somehow "linked". The most basic link is just a //direct link//. 
L0028 
L0029 The pages are linked from other places by inserting a link, i.e. {{``[[[``//page-unix-name//]]]}} or even {{``[[[Page Unix name!!!]]]``}}. In the second case the string is internally //unixified// and both cases render to a link [[[page unix name]]]. If a link is red - page does not exist and can be created by following the link. This is the safest way of creating new pages.
