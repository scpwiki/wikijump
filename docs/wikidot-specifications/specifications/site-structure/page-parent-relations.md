# Parent-page relations

- Feature ID: `page-parent-relations`
- Category: `site-structure`
- Documentation status: `documented`
- Specification source: frozen local Wikidot documentation corpus
- Behavioral authority: documentation-derived; live Wikidot wins if tested behavior conflicts

## Purpose

Implement the documented Wikidot site-structure capability “Parent-page relations”, including its identity, relationships, routes, and rendering implications.

## Implementation contract

- The persistence model MUST represent the documented entity and relationships.
- Public links, routes, selection behavior, permissions, and rendered structure MUST preserve those relationships.
- Imported Wikidot identifiers and URLs MUST remain compatibility-stable.

Every explicit default, accepted value, rejected value, alias, limit, interaction, output form, URL form, permission rule, and stated limitation in the evidence below is part of this specification. Examples are conformance fixtures. Text that merely describes the documentation site or presents a live demo is informative rather than normative.

If the documentation is silent or contradictory, the implementation MUST fail closed or preserve the existing literal behavior until a live Wikidot experiment supplies a stable expectation. The spec and catalog must then be updated with that evidence.


## Suggested public TDD seams

These seams are recommendations. The implementation agent must present and confirm the actual seam map before writing tests.

- Public HTTP route and browser-visible UI
- Public service/API boundary for persistent state and permissions

## Feature-specific implementation notes

- No feature-specific implementation note beyond the corpus contract.

L0058 ++ Parent pages
L0059 
L0060 //Parent// relations allow to introduce page structure (like in site maps). The results of setting a parent page are:
L0061 * breadcrumbs navigation appear at the top of the page,
L0062 * easier to come back to the parent page,
L0063 * easier listing (see [[[doc:ChildPages module]]] and [[[doc:PageTree module]]])
L0064 
L0065 These documentation pages use parent relations. Just see how it works and how it makes the navigation easier.
