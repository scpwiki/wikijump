All fonts are in the `woff2` format for maximum compression. This is particularly important for the CJK fonts, which even after compression are multiple megabytes in size. If you need to add fonts, and don't know how to convert them to `woff2`, use this wonderful site: https://kombu.kanejaku.org/.

Additionally, the usage of variable fonts is encouraged. They are typically much smaller in file size compared to traditional fonts, and are by design much more versatile.
