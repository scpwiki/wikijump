 * 1. `Tree` maps to a `TokenizerBuffer`
 * 2. `Chunk` maps to a `SerializedParserContext`
 *
 * Recovering a `TokenizerBuffer` from a `Tree` allows the tokenizer to
 * reuse its previous tokenization of the tree's respective document.
 *
 * Recovering a `SerializedParserContext` allows the parser to reuse its
 * previous parse of the tokenizer's output, which is emitted into `Chunk` objects.
