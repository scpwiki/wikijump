**Item #:** SCP-4513

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4513 is contained in a standard object storage locker in Site-19.

**Description:** SCP-4513 is a Brush Master brand large drum wood-chipper. 

SCP-4513's anomalous quality occurs when any form of printed literary media is placed into its intake hopper. 

After SCP-4513 consumes such a form of media, rather than the expected output of shredded paper, it will produce a watery substance superficially resembling milk. This substance (SCP-4513-B) changes the narrative structure of any literary media it is exposed to. These alterations result in a text that more closely resembles the media SCP-4513-B was formed from (in style and prose).

**Testing Log:** Several tests were performed using SCP-4513-B. A filled IRS W-2 tax form, provided by Researcher Andrew Thompson, was used as a control for the different varieties of SCP-4513-B to be applied to.

> The mahogany slab separating the captain from his sailor was littered with papers -- ink scrawls on parchment listing nills and tips and debts and payments, all resting on the broad white shoulders of one Captain Two-Form. Even as this cruel Pharoah of the Oppression scanned the page with his all seeing eyes, his flock trembled in awful fear at the utter power resting before him; the power to end a man's livelihood with a single stroke of a quill -- a weapon most desired, but entrusted to a small few under the watchful gaze of the Internal Revenue Service.
> 
> Jim Thompson's observation on the nature of his captor was cut short by the wax-sealed envelope thrust in his face by the thin, papery hands of Two-Form.

> "Eyes up, lad! You 'dun good, landing a one-hundredth-and-eightieth lay aboard the good ship //the Foundation// in only a single year of service! Not a feat many a man could accomplish. Though -- this has the unfortunate consequence of heightening the amount of coin good Father Samuel will tear from your grasp the moment we make landfall. However: I have a weapon most sinister that can aid you against him."

> Two-Form grinned, displaying a mouth filled with shockingly white teeth, like a quarry of enamel buried under a disgusting facade.
> 
> "Tell me, boy -- do you know what a deductible is?"

> Jim Thompson fingered the wedding ring on his finger. The band had cost him a pretty penny, but it was far more beautiful than the marriage it had been for. Susan -- his wife -- was cold & distant. She just didn't satisfy him anymore. Nothing did.

> HR Officer Form's musky voice snapped him out of his reverie. Jim stammered out a response, caught off-guard. "Y-yes, Officer?"

> Again, they both tittered and giggled for a moment, before both looking up at the same instant. Their eyes met, and something passed between them. Jim held the connection a moment longer, but Form broke it off. But Form wasn't fooling anyone, least of all himself. Both of them knew what had changed in that instant.

> Form fumbled, sweat dripping from his brow, as he handed Jim a sealed envelope.

> "I-I'm sorry, Thompson. We can't fully deduct that unfortunate hospital bill from January."

> Now was the moment. Jim had to make a choice. Do or die. Make what might be the biggest mistake of his life, or go through the rest of his existence wondering what could have been.

> He looked up, Form's eyes, and purred out a single sentence.
