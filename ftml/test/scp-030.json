In addition, SCP-030 has demonstrated knowledge on these topics along research lines that do not appear in the historical record.

The sarcophagus lid was shattered during the excavation, exposing SCP-030 to daylight. Upon being struck by the sun's rays, SCP-030 roused from its inert state to one of mild activity within a few seconds, stating, \"Good afternoon\" to the assembled construction team.
