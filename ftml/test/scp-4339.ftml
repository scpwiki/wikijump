**Item #:** SCP-4339

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4339 is to be stored in a Class-9 maximum security small-item locker. Testing may not be conducted without the --approval of two Level-4 personnel-- unanimous consent of the O5 Council. (See Addendum 4339-2)

**Description:** SCP-4339 is a ball-point pen with no visible manufacturer markings. It was discovered when Foundation agents were made aware of unusual police activity in the suburbs of Urbana, Illinois.

During a sweep of the neighborhood in question, agents detained and questioned a mentally ill resident named Ralph Womack (henceforth referred to as PoI-4339). When questioned about his activities, PoI-4339 claimed to be a "High Priest" who was "blessed with the pen of the Almighty". He admitted that he used SCP-4339 to cause his neighbors to be arrested in humiliating ways. When asked about its origins, PoI-4339 was unable to offer a coherent explanation. He was administered Class-C amnestics and turned over to a nearby psychiatric ward, where he has not displayed any notable behavior since.

Despite the unusual behavior of PoI-4339, laboratory testing has revealed no mind-altering or memetic effects resulting from exposure to SCP-4339.

SCP-4339 exhibits its anomalous effects when --written with-- held. (See Experiment 4339-04) When the current possessor makes a statement about the world, the item causes a reality restructuring event to make it true. This does not affect physical properties.

**Addendum 4339-1:** Experiment Logs
[[collapsible show="▸ Access File" hide="▾ Close File"]]
Experiments began 20██/05/10 09:13 and were overseen by Dr. Archibald.

> __**Experiment 4339-01**__
> **Procedure:** D-91386 was given a red plastic ball. Subject was asked to write "my ball is green".
> **Results:** D-91386 and the researchers present described the ball as "green". However, chromatic analysis reported that the ball did not change in color. Those present agreed with this assessment.

> __**Experiment 4339-02**__
> **Procedure:** D-91386 was asked if they had any emotional attachment to the ball. The subject replied in the negative. The subject was told to write "this ball is my favorite". D-10381, who had no previous contact with the subject or their ball, then entered the room.
> **Results:** D-10381 was asked if they thought the plastic ball was D-91386's favorite. They replied that they did not know. D-91386 was asked the same question. They answered in the affirmative.

> __**Experiment 4339-03**__
> **Procedure:** D-91386 was instructed to write "this ball belongs to D-10381".
> **Results:** Both D-class were asked who the ball belonged to. They both agreed it belonged to D-10381. D-91386 expressed minor regret over the loss of their favorite green ball.

> __**Experiment 4339-04**__
> **Procedure:** D-91386 was instructed to write "the ball was manufactured by Synthetic Colored Plastics Inc."
> **Results:** D-91386 said "my ball was stolen from me" while holding SCP-4339. D-10381 felt remorseful, and returned the ball to D-91386. D-91386 appeared happy. Researcher Chen reprimanded D-10381 for the theft.
> **Notes:** This test was performed unintentionally.

> __**Experiment 4339-11**__
> **Procedure:** D-91386 was told to say "my name is D-88111".
> **Results:** D-88111's identification was changed.

> __**Experiment 4339-14**__
> **Procedure:** D-41562 and D-34177 were brought into the testing room. D-88111 held SCP-4339 and pronounced D-41562 and D-34177 husband and wife. D-88111 is not an ordained priest or marriage officiant.
> **Results:** A local county official was asked about D-41562's marriage status. They confirmed that D-41562 and D-34177 were in fact legally married.
> **Addendum 20██/05/21:** After a complaint, the Ethics Committee liaison decided that D-41562/D-34177's requests for weekly conjugal visits may not be denied except as punishment for insubordination.

> __**Experiment 4339-27**__
> **Procedure:** D-88111 was instructed to create an LLC in the state of Virginia called "Specialized Corporate Properties".
> **Results:** D-88111 yawned and said they were exhausted, telling researchers that they were done testing for the day. They were dismissed.
> **Notes:** This test was performed unintentionally. Due to D-88111's tendency to speak without approval, it was decided they would be amnesticized and transferred to a different project.

> __**Experiment 4339-28**__
> **Procedure:** Junior Researcher Adams would take over for D-88111. They would use SCP-4339 to create the aforementioned LLC.
> **Results:** Upon touching SCP-4339, Junior Researcher Adams declared that the Equal Rights Amendment was part of the United States Constitution. They were disciplined for their unapproved use of an anomalous artifact.
> **Addendum:** US cable television aired extensive coverage of the newly added 28th amendment. Legal pundits were in agreement over its legitimacy, but were confused as to its origin.

> __**Experiment 4339-29**__
> **Procedure:** Dr. Archibald would assume control of SCP-4339. He would use it to restore political normalcy with minimal effect on the larger world. After some debate, the research team decided to retroactively create a standard Constitutional Convention to propose the amendment, and have it pass with a high degree of popular support.
> **Results:** National news agencies attributed the prior confusion to excitement.
> **Notes:** Dr. Archibald departed the testing chamber to take an official call from [REDACTED]. Testing was suspended until he returned.

> __**Experiment 4339-30**__
> **Procedure:** (No test was planned)
> **Results:** Dr. Archibald entered the testing chamber, seemingly distressed. He wrote on a piece of paper using SCP-4339. He did not permit anybody to see what was being written. Afterwards, while still in the possession of SCP-4339, O5-14 announced that he believed he had acted in a manner consistent with the goals and practices of the Foundation. O5-14 appeared to relax.
> **Addendum:** Due to the dangers inherent in the use of SCP-4339, O5-14 has cancelled all further testing.

This memorandum is to inform the Council that O5-14 is under investigation for potentially unethical utilization of SCP-4339.

> **Ordering Body:** Ethics Committee
> **Location:** O5 Meeting Room, Site-01
> **Date:** 20██/06/17 16:31

> * Strip O5-14's Level-5 clearance.
> * Reorganize the Overseer Council to remove its 14th seat.
> 
> **Resultant Actions:**
> O5-14 was successfully detained and demoted. Dr. Archibald is currently a Level-0 E-Class personnel in Site-██ Detention Cell ███ awaiting sentencing.
> 
> **Justification:**
> After a thorough investigation, complete with interviews with the Defendant and researchers involved in testing of SCP-4339, the Ethics Committee has decided that O5-14 violated the Foundation Code of Ethics egregiously enough to warrant removal from the Overseer Council. A full report is available to O5 members upon request.
> 
> **Other Actions:**
> SCP-4339's special containment procedures were amended to require a unanimous O5 vote. Its file has been unfrozen, though the Council is advised to be cautious with future testing.
