Wikijump is the [SCP Wiki](http://www.scpwiki.com)'s fork of the unmaintained [Wikidot](https://github.com/gabrys/wikidot).
It aims to significantly refactor legacy code, remove misfeatures and dead code, and implement new useful features and bugfixes that current users of Wikidot need today.

This project is being developed by the English SCP Wiki's [Technical Team](http://05command.wikidot.com/technical-staff-main) as part of [Project Foundation](http://www.scpwiki.com/forum/c-3335628/general-information).
Issues are tracked on our [JIRA](https://scuttle.atlassian.net/browse/WJ).

Questions and comments can be posted in our [General Information forum](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-3335628/general-information), or in [`#site11` on SkipIRC](http://www.scpwiki.com/chat-guide).

## Contributing

We welcome any suggestions or requests, which can be made in our [Feature Requests forum](http://www.scpwiki.com/forum/c-3335630/feature-requests).

If you would like to offer to volunteer some of your time to Wikijump development in the future, please post in one of our [Recruitment threads](http://www.scpwiki.com/forum/c-3335629/recruitment). We may request your help when we need it.

### Development

We don't have a lot of documentation here yet. See [development.md](docs/development.md) and [install.md](docs/install.md) for information on running a local instance of Wikijump.
