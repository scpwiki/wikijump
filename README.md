Wikijump began as the [SCP Wiki](https://scpwiki.com)'s fork of the unmaintained [Wikidot](https://github.com/gabrys/wikidot).
It seeks to implement [Project Foundation](https://scpwiki.com/forum/c-3335628/general-information) using lessons learned from Wikidot's legacy PHP code and cutting-edge Wikidot research from other technical projects.
The goal is to provide a scalable, maintainable platform with features, improvements, and bugfixes that current users of Wikidot need today.

This project is being primarily developed by the English SCP Wiki's [Technical Team](http://05command.wikidot.com/technical-staff-main) as part of Project Foundation, however other contributors are welcome.
Issues are tracked on our [Jira](https://scuttle.atlassian.net/browse/WJ).

Questions and comments can be posted in our [General Information forum](https://scpwiki.com/forum/c-3335628/general-information), or in [`#site11` on SkipIRC](https://scpwiki.com/chat-guide).

## Contributing

We welcome any suggestions or requests, which can be made in our [Feature Requests forum](https://scpwiki.com/forum/c-3335630/feature-requests).

If you would like to volunteer some of your time to Wikijump development, join the Discord and chat with us! (Invites can be received in `#site11` or by DMing a current Wikijump team member).
