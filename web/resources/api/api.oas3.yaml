    ## Introduction

    This page documents the Wikijump API, which is a HTTP interface
    that lets you easily interact with Wikijump programatically.

    The API is defined as a OpenAPI 3.0.3 schema file.
    The implementation of this API in the Wikijump backend very closely matches this schema.

    Wikijump (including this API) is subject to change as the project evolves.

    ## Usage

    The Wikijump API is centered around the JSON format for both sending and receiving.
    The data expected/returned by the API will always be wrapped inside an object, even if that object contains only
    a single property. The following code-block demonstrates an example payload:
    ```json
    {
      "login": "fake@example.com",
      "password": "pa$$word"
    }
    ```

    The only exceptions to the 'JSON only' standard are files and avatars, which are sent directly.

    If you plan to use this API with some sort of service, e.g. an IRC bot, it should be noted that this API is
    fundamentally geared towards supporting frontends. Endpoints usually point to individual resources or
    interactions, which means that any sort of service requesting information on many resources will have to send
    a large amount of API requests if it were to use this API as a frontend would.

    However, the Wikijump API has a special endpoint, `/query`, which allows complex and "closer to the metal"
    transactions with the Wikijump database. Services, but also frontends, can use this endpoint to
    request information efficiently on a multitude of resources without excessive API requests and bandwidth usage.

    The `/query` endpoint is currently not available.

    ## Changes from Wikidot

    > Breaking changes to previously private components of the Wikidot interface or API
    will not be mentioned in this section.

    The following features have been deprecated, removed, or rendered nonfunctional:
    - Contacts
    - Account types (pro accounts)
    - OneSignal
    - Advertising
    - XML-RPC API
    - Pingbacks
    - Twitter integration ("Tweet My Wiki")
    - Site traffic statistics (Google Analytics is still available!)
    - Per-site user profiles
    - Inter-site promotion
    - Custom layouts
    - Custom footer

    The following features have been made available universally:
    - HTTPS (required - Wikijump is designed to use HTTPS only)
    - Blocking site cloning
    - Disabling the display of karma site-wide

    These changes reflect Wikijump's transition away from Wikidot's business model and outdated infrastructure.

    Finally, the following features **will be supported**, but aren't quite available in this API yet:
    - Watching
    - Activity pages (user, site, etc.) (requires `/query`)
    - Searching (requires `/query`)
